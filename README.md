# Expo CLI: Unexpected Build/Startup Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet often frustrating issue with Expo CLI: unexpected errors during builds or startup.  These errors usually stem from a mismatch between the locally installed Expo CLI version and the project's dependencies, or from corrupted cache files.  The error message rarely pinpoints the true cause.

The `expoBug.js` file showcases a scenario where running the project might produce vague error messages despite seemingly correct configuration.  The `expoBugSolution.js` provides solutions to address this issue.
