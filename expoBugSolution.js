To resolve this, follow these steps:

1. **Clear the Expo cache:** Run `expo start --clear` in your terminal. This clears any potentially corrupted cached files.
2. **Verify Expo CLI version:** Check the globally installed version using `expo --version`.  Compare this to the version specified in your `package.json`'s `expo` dependencies. Make sure they match or follow the expo documentation on how to update.
3. **Update Expo CLI:** If there is a mismatch, update your Expo CLI to the required version using `npm install -g expo-cli@<version>` (replace `<version>` with the desired version).
4. **Reinstall dependencies:**  After updating, run `npm install` in your project directory to refresh your project's node modules.
5. **Check for typos:** In case of expo start error, check that the name of your project is correct in your package.json
6. **If the issue persists:** Consider deleting your `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again to ensure a clean dependency installation.  In extreme cases, deleting your `.expo` folder might be necessary. Always commit any changes to your code to git before running these actions as precaution.
